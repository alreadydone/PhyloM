# Getting started

You can get the code for different parts of this project using the following command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/algo-cancer/PhyloM.git
```

# Branching Inference
The code for this part is placed under Branching_Inference folder.

See https://github.com/algo-cancer/PhyloM/blob/master/Branching_Inference/README.md for the instructions.

# Noise Inference
The code for this part has been provided under Noise_Inference folder.
See https://github.com/algo-cancer/PhyloM/blob/master/Noise_Inference/README.md for the instructions.

# Noise Elimination
The code for this part could be found under Noise_Elimination folder.
See https://github.com/algo-cancer/PhyloM/blob/master/Noise_Elimination/README.md for the instructions.



## System configs
All the experiments in this work are performed using **Carbonate**, a computer cluster at Indiana University. We used deep learning (DL) nodes in Carbonate.
These nodes features 12 GPU-accelerated Lenovo ThinkSystem SD530 , each equipped with two Intel Xeon Gold 6126 12-core CPUs, two NVIDIA GPU accelerators (eight with Tesla P100s; four with Tesla V100s), and 192 GB of RAM. A Red Hat Enterprise 7.x is running on these nodes and we used Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda, Inc., Tensorflow 1.8.0, and Keras 2.2.0.
